Database Design project and learning experience

To implement: 
- organization for front-end
- redux store(?) to keep track of the current user logged in (this is so we know what user to post, add questions to)
- login page
- encryption for login password - in progress
- interesting queries for questions; i.e. relating demographic information to answer picked
- data visualization in charts, tables etc on front end
- questions page with many browsable and answerable questions
- a way for user to see all questions they've asked, the answers to each
- report system for bad answers (and/or questions?)

Stretch Goals
- personal profile page
-   analytics for your own answers to various questions and those asking them
-   view / edit personal profile information (political party affiliation may change, for ex)
- email subscription service?
- advanced analytics
- currency / payment model (turn this into a real business, if it has potential lol)
